Customer Segmentation Project

Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning to segment mall customers based on demographic and behavioral features. It uses K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer groups and explores how RFM Analysis can enhance segmentation in transactional datasets.


📈 K-Means Clustering:

Used Elbow Method to find optimal clusters.

Segmented customers based on Age, Income, and Spending Score.

🧩 Cluster Profiling:

Identified high-value, moderate, and low-engagement segments.

🧠 RFM Analysis (Conceptual):

Though not applied to this dataset, RFM is ideal for transactional data.

Adds behavioral depth:

Recency – How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency – How often a customer purchases

Monetary – How much money a customer spends

RFM can be layered onto demographic clusters to prioritize retention and loyalty campaigns.

RESULT
✅ Created distinct customer segments with clear behavioral traits.

✅ Enabled data-driven decisions for promotions and engagement.

✅ Highlighted how RFM can enrich segmentation in e-commerce or loyalty-driven environments.
