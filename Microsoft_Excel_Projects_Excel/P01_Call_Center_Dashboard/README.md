# 📊 Call Center Dashboard 

## Overview
This project presents a **Call Center Data Report Dashboard** built to analyze call volumes, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and revenue impact. It leverages **Power BI, SQL, and Excel** to transform raw call center data into actionable insights.

### **Situation**
- Call centers handle thousands of customer interactions daily, but managers lacked a consolidated view of performance metrics.  
- Data was scattered across multiple sources (call logs, customer ratings, transaction records), making it difficult to track KPIs like call volume, revenue, and customer satisfaction.  
- Business leaders needed a **single dashboard** to monitor representative performance, regional trends, and customer experience.

### **Task**
- Design and develop a **comprehensive dashboard** that:  
  - Tracks **call volumes, durations, and revenue**.  
  - Highlights **representative-wise performance**.  
  - Provides **customer satisfaction metrics** (ratings, happy callers).  
  - Enables **regional and demographic analysis** (city, gender distribution).  
- Ensure the dashboard is **interactive, visually appealing, and business-ready** for leadership reporting.

### **Action**
- **Data Preparation**  
  - Extracted raw call center data using **SQL queries**.  
  - Cleaned and transformed datasets in **Power Query**.  
  - Applied **feature engineering** (e.g., day-wise call distribution, gender segmentation).  

- **Dashboard Development**  
  - Built interactive visuals in **Power BI**:  
    - Line charts for monthly call trends.  
    - Bar charts for day-wise distribution and gender analysis.  
    - KPI cards for calls, revenue, durations, ratings, and happy callers.  
    - Representative-wise performance comparison.  
  - Integrated **DAX measures** for dynamic calculations (e.g., % of calls, ranking).  
  - Designed a **regional drill-down table** for city-level insights.  

- **Business Storytelling**  
  - Structured the dashboard to answer key leadership questions:  
    - *Which representatives drive the most revenue?*  
    - *Which days have peak call volumes?*  
    - *How do customer ratings vary across regions?*  
  - Ensured clarity with **consistent formatting, icons, and tooltips**.

### **Result**
- Delivered a **professional-grade dashboard** that:  
  - Consolidated **1,000+ calls** into actionable insights.  
  - Identified **top-performing representatives** (R02, R03, R05 with ~$20K revenue each).  
  - Revealed **regional trends** (Cleveland had higher male callers, Columbus balanced gender distribution).  
  - Improved leadership decision-making by highlighting **customer satisfaction drivers**.  
- The dashboard is now used for **weekly performance reviews**, helping managers optimize staffing, training, and customer engagement strategies.
