# 📊 PO2_HR Attrition Analysis and Dashboard (Power BI)

## ⭐ Project Summary — STAR Method

**🧩 Situation**  
The HR team of an organization lacked clear insights into why employees were leaving (attrition) and what factors influenced retention. They needed a business intelligence solution that provided actionable insights from HR data across demographics, job roles, and tenure to support strategic decision-making.

**🎯 Task**  
Design and build a **Power BI dashboard** that:
- Aggregates HR data (employee records, tenure, status)
- Identifies patterns and trends in attrition
- Enables interactive exploration by HR stakeholders
- Highlights key drivers and areas needing action

**🛠️ Action**  
I completed the following steps:

1. **Data Import & Preparation**
   - Imported raw HR data (CSV/Excel) into Power BI Desktop.
   - Performed cleaning in **Power Query**:
     - Handled missing values
     - Corrected data types (dates, text, numeric)
     - Created calculated columns (e.g., Tenure, Attrition Status)
   - Established a clean, optimized data model.

2. **Data Modeling & DAX**
   - Created meaningful **calculated columns** and **DAX measures**:
     - Attrition rate
     - Average tenure
     - Monthly attrition trends
   - Built date tables for time-based slicers and analysis.

3. **Dashboard Design & Visualization**
   - Built interactive visuals:
     - Attrition by department, region, gender, and age
     - Tenure distributions
     - Trend charts showing monthly attrition
     - KPI cards for immediate metrics (Total Attrition, Avg Tenure)
   - Added slicers for user control (Department, Region, Status).

4. **Insights Communication**
   - Designed the report for clarity and insight consumption.
   - Applied color coding and labels for readability.
   - Included actionable insights panels narrating key findings.

**🏆 Result**  
The HR Attrition Dashboard provides:
- A single, interactive interface for HR to explore attrition trends.
- Clear visuals that show which groups are most affected.
- Actionable insights (e.g., high attrition departments, tenure risk zones).
- Quick filtering by demographic slices for deeper diagnosis.

This solution supports data-driven retention strategies and decision-making across HR leadership.
